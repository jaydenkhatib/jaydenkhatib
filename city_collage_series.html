        <p class="headtext">This is a series of collages I made about cities that have been important in my life for ARTF 1200.</p>
        <div class="collage"><img class="boston" src="boston.JPG">
            <p>This first collage is about Boston. I chose <br>
                to focus mostly on bands and venues from in and <br>
                around Boston since leaving my hometown music scene <br>
                was my biggest hangup about moving up here.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="collage"><img class="beirut" src="beirut.JPG">
            <p>This collage is about Beirut. I chose Beirut because<br>
                it was the first place I ever visited outside of <br>
                North America (and it has really nice architecture).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="collage"><img class="asheville" src="asheville.JPG">
            <p>This collage is about Asheville. This is my favorite<br>
                city in the U.S.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="collage"><img class="miami" src="miami.JPG">
            <p>This collage is about Miami. Half of my family is from <br>
                Miami or West Palm Beach.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="collage"><img class="trains" src="trains.JPG">
            <p>This collage is about trains. These are transit lines<br>
                or stops from a bunch of different cities I've been to.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="collage"><img class="portland" src="portland.JPG">
            <p>This collage is about Portland. This is my second <br>
                favorite city in the U.S.</p>
